```

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! There are plenty of `unimplemented!()` methods that one can fill in. Make sure that the documentation matches the functionality, and to add a unit test for it. If you don't wish to write a test, just add the function for it and leave it for someone else to fill it in.
