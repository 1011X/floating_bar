# Floating Bar

Provides the **floating-bar** type, which allows for efficient representation of
rational numbers without loss of precision. It is based on [this blog post](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/floatingbar/floatingbar.htm).

## Use

To use this library in your code, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`
file under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
floating_bar = "0.1.0"
```

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! There are plenty of `unimplemented!()` methods that one
can fill in. Make sure that the documentation matches the functionality, and to
add a unit test for it. If you don't wish to write a test, just add the
function for it and leave it for someone else to fill it in.
